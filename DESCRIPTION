Description: ASSIGN is a computational tool to evaluate the pathway
        deregulation/activation status in individual patient samples.
        ASSIGN employs a flexible Bayesian factor analysis approach
        that adapts predetermined pathway signatures derived either
        from knowledge-based literatures or from perturbation
        experiments to the cell-/tissue-specific pathway signatures.
        The deregulation/activation level of each context-specific
        pathway is quantified to a score, which represents the extent
        to which a patient sample encompasses the pathway
        deregulation/activation signature.
